## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install **Node.js** and **npm** on your local machine.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/back-to-the-future-collecting.git
   cd back-to-the-future-collecting
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Deployment
1. Build the production version of the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your preferred hosting service.

#### Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```
2. Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```
3. Configure the `homepage` field in your `package.json` with your GitHub repository URL:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name"
   ```
4. Deploy the app to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   Your app will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`.

## How to Use
1. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed URL).
2. Refresh the page to discover a new unique item.
3. Save the item to your digital wallet as a wallet pass.
4. Share your wallet passes with others and try to collect all available passes.
5. Feel free to fork the project and create your own future items or entirely different collections by leveraging the easy scaffolding in the `items.js` file.
