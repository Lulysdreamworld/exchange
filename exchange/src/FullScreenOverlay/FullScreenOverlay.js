            <h3 className="heading">Survival</h3>
            <p className="body">This class of futures includes those considered ‘<i>likely</i> to happen,’ based on the continuation of current <i>trends</i>. The most likely future, often called ‘business-as-usual,’ is a simple linear extension of the present. However, trends may not continue indefinitely and can be disrupted or replaced unexpectedly. While some see trend analysis as central to foresight, it produces a narrower range of futures, leading to limited perspectives. The key question for Probable futures is: ‘What is <i>likely</i> to happen?’.</p>

            <h3 className="heading">Desire</h3>
            <p className="body">This class includes futures that ‘<i>could</i> happen’ based on <i>current knowledge</i> of how the world works, rather than future discoveries. They stem not from specific facts but from our more general knowledge of ‘how things work,’ such as physical laws, causation, or human systems. For example, replacing the global economy with a system based on ‘hugs and kisses’ instead of currency would fall outside what is currently considered plausible. While such a system is possible, it is not plausible by today’s standards. This category represents a smaller subset of futures than the possible. The key question for Plausible futures is: ‘What <i>could</i> happen?’.</p>

They may rely on knowledge we do not yet possess (e.g., Star Trek’s ‘warp drive’) or outright defy current physical laws. Such futures could range from time travel to entire civilizations communicating telepathically or existing in alternate dimensions. While these scenarios may seem preposterous, they are not entirely ruled out by the limitless possibilities of <i>future knowledge</i>.
